My name is Nathaniel Saunders, I'm a recent graduate of the 3 year Computer Programming and Analysis advanced diploma program offered by Conestoga College. 
I'm currently based in Waterloo, Ontario.

Throughout my academic career I have gained a great deal of experience working with a variety of programming languages, some of these languages include
Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and, most predominantly, C#. I have worked with these specific languages in many ways, including mobile application 
development, game development, enterprise application development, and internet application development. On top of this I also have a great deal of experience 
working with various frameworks such as ASP.NET, ASP .NET Core, and Spring Boot to develop these enterprise and internet applications, which have also required
the development of complex database systems using Microsoft SQL Server and SQL scripts within the applications themselves.

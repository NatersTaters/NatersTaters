My name is Nathaniel Saunders, I'm a Software Developer currently working with Brock Solutions who recently graduated from Conestoga College with an OCAD in Computer Programming and Analysis.

Throughout my academic and professional career I have gained expertise working with various programming languages/technologies, (C#, Java, HTML, JavaScript). I have used these languages for developing mobile, enterprise and internet applications as well as games and MES Software. Additionally, I have extensive experience working with ASP .NET Core, and Spring Boot frameworks in the development of these applications, which required developing complex database systems using MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQL scripts within the applications themselves.

I also have experience using multiple general-purpose programming tools, including Visual Studio 2019, GitHub Desktop, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Android Studio, FactoryTalk ProductionCentre, and many others.

My ultimate goal is to apply and extend my existing skillset, to become a leading professional in this field.
